# Damped Traub's method

This GitHub repository contains the implementation in Python to visualize the basins of attraction in the complex plane for the Damped Traub's Method family. The Damped Traub's Method is a numerical algorithm used for finding roots of complex polynomials. The basins of attraction provide insights into how the method converges to different roots for different initial guesses.
